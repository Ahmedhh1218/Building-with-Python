# Building with Python

Welcome to my repository of Python projects! Here, I will be sharing my code for a variety of projects, from beginner to advanced. I am always learning new things, so I hope this repository can be a resource for other Python enthusiasts who are looking to learn and grow.

## Projects

I will be adding new projects to this repository regularly. Here are some of the projects that I am currently working on:

* A voice assistant project
* A machine learning project that uses TensorFlow
* A data visualization project that uses Matplotlib
